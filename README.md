This web app allows users to customize their CV with form validation and export it as a PDF. This app taught me the importance of planning as I had to refactor this code multiple times to lift the React state and allow separate components to be rendered and exported. I also familiarized myself with OOP architecture allowing for better organization of related data. I utilized React, JS, HTML, and CSS in this project.
